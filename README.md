### Running the Notebook
1. On a local machine (or preferably in a virtual environment), install the required *Python* packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt` from a shell.
2. Create the `dataset` directory in the same level as the notebook: `Activity 2 - ADC, DAC and Aliasing Signals.ipynb`.
3. Download and extract the `.wav` files from this [link](TBA).
4. Transfer all the downloaded `.wav` files inside the `dataset` directory that was created earlier.
5. Run *Jupyter Notebook* and open the `Activity 2 - ADC, DAC and Aliasing Signals.ipynb`. Proceed on running the cell blocks.
