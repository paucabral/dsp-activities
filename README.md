# Activity 5 - Proving Mathematical Properties
*An activity for the course CPE 027-CPE41S3 - Digital Signal Processing and Application.*

**Code written by:** Pau Cabral

### Running the Notebook
1. On a local machine (or preferably in a virtual environment), install the required *Python* packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt` from a shell.
2. Create the `dataset` directory in the same level as the notebook: `Activity 5 - Proving Mathematical Properties`.
3. Download and extract the `.csv` file from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HcjjuCeSB-TMo22zuxGHd40agsgbISxm?usp=sharing).
4. Transfer the downloaded `.csv` file inside the `dataset` directory that was created earlier.
5. Run *Jupyter Notebook* and open the `Activity 5 - Proving Mathematical Properties`. Proceed on running the cell blocks.
